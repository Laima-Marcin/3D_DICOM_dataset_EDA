 3D DICOM volumes large dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
 
In this notebook we discuss some of the methods that could be applied in dataset analysis, when we are dealing with large multitude of 3D volumes. 
A lot of the same principles could be applied here as were used with individual volume EDA.

In this case we look at a collection of images and try to figure out what we are looking at. 
We look at some of the techniques that might help us collect relevant meta information.
